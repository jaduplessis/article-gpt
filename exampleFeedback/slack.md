**Original writing:** Revolutionising Business Processes: Integrating Slack with AWS Using Serverless Architectures
Feedback: Title: using -> utilising?

**Section:** Introduction
**Original writing:** Smart automation is a pivotal component in the dynamic arena of business operations, greatly augmenting efficiency. Slack, with its widespread use and extensive integrations, is one of the platforms driving this automation. Today's companies are burdened with essential yet time-consuming tasks, from the detailed process of onboarding new team members to the careful coordination of peer reviews and project workflows. This is where automation comes in, transforming these labour-intensive activities into streamlined processes. This integration revolutionizes not just everyday tasks but also sparks innovation by, for example, sending direct message alerts for cloud resource overspending - a significant advantage, especially when integrated with external resources. The traditional go-to solution, autogenerated emails, while useful, often miss the mark in engagement and seamlessness. Contrast that with the dynamic alert features on homepages, which cut through the noise, delivering crucial updates right when users need them.
**Feedback:** There is a bit of a uni / essay vibes tone (especially in introduction) e.g. 'dynamic arena of business', 'woven into the fabric of slack apps', 'augmenting efficiency' etc. I think its fine to include these, there just seems a lot and at times gives the article strange tones.

**Section:** Slack bots in action
**Original writing:** While standard Slack apps offer basic functionality like tracking sick days or device security alerts, they might only partially cater to unique organizational needs. Custom bots are where you get to play. At my own company, for example, we've leveraged these bots for everything from LLM-powered automatic translations in international teams to more complex integrations, seamlessly melding with our existing processes.
**Feedback:** "from social pairings using optimisation algorithms to more complex integrations" seems like you've only done a slack bot to do social pairings.

**Section:** Create a New Slack App
**Original writing:** Start by following the Slack API Hello World tutorial steps. This guide assists in creating a basic Slack app. During this process, note the 'SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET' and 'SLACK_BOT_TOKEN', which are critical for your app's functionality and security. These values are found in the Basic Information and OAuth & Permissions pages, respectively. Configuring the app is an iterative process, you won't be able to
**Feedback:** "Create a new slack app" section is unfinished.

**Section:** Basic Architecture (implied by feedback on the architectural diagram)
**Original writing:** (Not directly quoted but related to the visual content described as previewing the schematic of the setup.)
**Feedback:** Archi diagram seems a bit messy e.g. lines not straight, writing in strange places.

**Section:** Crafting Lambda Functions: The Driving Forces Behind Slack Events (implied by feedback on lambda functions not interacting with Slack)
**Original writing:** We now delve into creating Lambda functions, each specifically designed to handle different Slack events. In this example, we'll focus on two actions, demonstrating how the lambda structure can be adapted for various purposes.
**Feedback:** Do some of the lambdas not interact with slack? As this is not represented in the diagram.
