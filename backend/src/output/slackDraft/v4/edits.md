1. Original chunk of writing: Serverless computing stands as the cornerstone of our technological metamorphosis.
   Suggested edit: Serverless computing, such as AWS Lambda, stands as the cornerstone of our technological metamorphosis.
   Reasoning: Including AWS Lambda in the initial introduction of serverless computing provides context for readers not familiar with the concept.

2. Original chunk of writing: The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), a significant driving force in this transformation, isn't just a tool.
   Suggested edit: The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a significant driving force in this transformation. It's more than just a tool—it's a framework that simplifies the creation of custom Slack integrations by automating the deployment and management of cloud resources. 
   Reasoning: Providing immediate context and explanation about CDK helps to establish the author's expertise and guide the reader's understanding.

3. Original chunk of writing: In this walkthrough, I’ll guide you through ...
   Suggested edit: Before we dive into the walkthrough, let's delve into some essential concepts. AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. And the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. Now, having understood these, let's move into the walkthrough where I’ll guide you through ...
   Reasoning: Providing a brief introduction to AWS Lambda and CDK before the walkthrough helps the reader understand the context better.

4. Original chunk of writing: The landing Lambda API filters actions based on their action IDs.
   Suggested edit: The landing Lambda API, a function in AWS Lambda, filters actions based on their action IDs.
   Reasoning: Providing context to what the landing Lambda API is helps keep the reader engaged and understand the concepts better.

5. Original chunk of writing: In summary, this guide has walked you through a detailed step-by-step process of integrating Slack with AWS.
   Suggested edit: In summary, this guide has walked you through a detailed step-by-step process of integrating Slack with AWS, leveraging the power of AWS Lambda and the AWS CDK.
   Reasoning: Mentioning AWS Lambda and CDK in the conclusion re-emphasizes the main tools used in the process.

6. Original chunk of writing: The architectural diagram below previews the upcoming schematic.
   Suggested edit: The architectural diagram below provides a visual guide to the flow and dependencies between the various components of our serverless stack, including AWS Lambda functions and the EventBridge event bus.
   Reasoning: Providing more context to what the architectural diagram represents helps the reader understand its relevance better. 

7. Original chunk of writing: This visual guide illuminates the flow and dependencies between the various components.
   Suggested edit: As depicted in this diagram, AWS Lambda functions are used to handle different Slack events, they send these events to an EventBridge event bus which routes the events based on predefined rules. This visual guide illuminates the flow and dependencies between these components.
   Reasoning: Providing more context to how the various components interact enhances the reader's understanding. 

8. Original chunk of writing: At the core of the interaction between your Slack application and AWS backend is the ‘/slack/events’ API endpoint.
   Suggested edit: At the core of the interaction between your Slack application and AWS backend, specifically AWS Lambda functions, is the ‘/slack/events’ API endpoint.
   Reasoning: Mentioning AWS Lambda in this context enhances the reader's understanding of how the Slack application interacts with the AWS backend. 

9. Original chunk of writing: In the final step, we establish an API Gateway.
   Suggested edit: In the final step, we establish an API Gateway, a fully managed service by AWS that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
   Reasoning: Providing an explanation of what an API Gateway is helps the reader understand its importance in the integration process.
