# Revolutionising Business Processes: Integrating Slack with AWS Using Serverless Architectures

**Introduction**

Navigating the ever-evolving landscape of business operations, it's clear that the key to unlocking efficiency lies in smart automation. Companies today are swamped with tasks that are vital yet draining – from the nitty-gritty of onboarding new team members to the meticulous coordination of peer reviews and project workflows. Here's where the magic of automation steps in, turning these time-consuming activities into streamlined processes. Imagine automating not just the mundane but also sparking innovation with things like direct message alerts for cloud resource overspending - a game-changer, especially when paired with external resources.

The traditional go-to solution, autogenerated emails, while useful, often miss the mark in engagement and seamlessness. Contrast that with the dynamic alert features on homepages, which cut through the noise, delivering crucial updates right when users need them.

Now, enter the realm of custom serverless Slack bots. Standard Slack apps are great for basics like tracking sick days or device security alerts (shoutout to apps like Kolide), but they fall short in catering to the unique needs of diverse organizations. Custom bots are where you get to play. At my own company, for example, we’ve leveraged these bots for everything from social pairings using optimization algorithms to more complex integrations, all seamlessly melding with our existing processes.

Serverless computing is at the heart of this transformation. Embracing a scale-to-zero model, it dynamically aligns with your traffic needs, cutting costs as you only pay for what you use. Lambda functions, woven into the fabric of Slack apps, respond to each user interaction, igniting a cascade of tailored actions. This is efficiency and responsiveness redefined.

And the real hero in this story? The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). It’s not just a tool; it's a revolution in custom Slack integrations. Embodying the essence of Infrastructure as Code, CDK is a developer’s dream, simplifying deployment and management of cloud resources. With the CDK in our arsenal, let’s embark on a journey to transform how businesses operate, blending efficiency with innovation in ways we've only just begun to explore.

**Example Application**

In this walkthrough, I’ll guide you through the process of creating a Slack app in the console and establishing an event bus—a central nervous system for distributing commands from Slack to individual lambdas responsible for performing tasks. While setting up two example events as a starting point, we'll lay the groundwork for expanding to numerous other operations. We will render a simple homepage and respond to a button click, all orchestrated within the handler of a Lambda. Our focus will also extend to creating an efficient routing system, channeling requests from Slack through the event bus to our lambdas, ensuring a robust and responsive solution.

**Create New Slack App**

Start by following the [Slack API Hello World tutorial](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/hello-world-bolt) steps. This guide assists in creating a basic Slack app. During this process, note the 'SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET' and 'SLACK_BOT_TOKEN', which are critical for your app’s functionality and security. These values are found in the Basic Information and OAuth & Permissions pages, respectively. Remember, configuring your app is an iterative process, so refine your app's configuration gradually.

**Create Backend Serverless Stack**

The Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a toolkit for creating Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It offers scalability, repeatability, and efficient resource management. To automate business processes, construct the serverless stack from the ground up, starting with individual resources like lambdas and an event bus. As you progress, you'll interconnect these components to form a complete stack. The architectural diagram below previews the upcoming schematic.

![Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 22.24.42.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1ff9bf7e-7f2f-46fe-b610-59b6e2b4fd83/8f79113d-7311-4b7e-aaa2-d90df1326188/Screenshot_2023-11-16_at_22.24.42.png)

This visual guide illuminates the flow and dependencies between the various components. As we delve into the specifics of each resource creation, keep this roadmap in mind.

**Set Up an EventBridge Event Bus**

At the heart of the interaction between your Slack application and the AWS backend is a single API endpoint, '/slack/events'. This endpoint serves as the primary hub for interactions. To efficiently parse and route various events and actions within your system, implementing an EventBus is crucial. It applies rules to incoming events to determine the appropriate resource for forwarding the action.

The key component is the **`putEvent`** function, which utilises the EventBridge client to manage event distribution. Each event, identified by its unique action, is routed to a specific Lambda function for processing the corresponding response. Below is the code for the EventBridge Adapter and the **`putEvent`** function.

```tsx
export class EventBridgeAdapter {
  eventBus: string;

  constructor(eventBus: string) {
    this.eventBus = eventBus;
  }
  
  putEvent(
    action: string,
    payload: Record<string, unknown>,
    detailType: string,
  ): Promise<PutEventsCommandOutput> {

    const event: PutEventsRequestEntry = {
      Source: action,
      Detail: JSON.stringify({ ...payload }),
      DetailType: detailType,
      EventBusName: this.eventBus,
    };

    client = new EventBridgeClient();

    const command = new PutEventsCommand({
      Entries: [event],
    });

    return client.send(command);
  }
}
```

**Create Lambda Functions to Handle Slack Events**

We now delve into creating Lambda functions, each specifically designed to handle different Slack events. In this example, we'll focus on two actions, demonstrating how the lambda structure can be adapted for various purposes.

A crucial step in this process is the instantiation of a new Bolt App and AWSLambdaReceiver within each lambda handler. This step is vital to avoid potential issues such as unintended actions or delayed responses, which can occur if these instances persist outside the handler.

The first action we'll explore is the 'app_home_opened' event, which is triggered when a user accesses the home tab of the app. This lambda function aims to render a user-specific page, which could include personalised content like targets, countdowns, or data from external services like DynamoDB.

```tsx
export const handler = async event => {
  const { token, user } = event.detail;

  const awsLambdaReceiver = new AwsLambdaReceiver({
    signingSecret: <SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET>,
  });

  // Instantiate app
  const app = new App({
    token: <SLACK_BOT_TOKEN>,
    receiver: awsLambdaReceiver,
  });

  // Display App Home
  const homeView: HomeView = {
    type: "home",
    callback_id: "home_view",
    blocks: createBlocksView(user)
  };

  await app.client.views.publish({
    token, user, view: homeView,
  });

	await awsLambdaReceiver.start()
};
```

The second function showcases the dynamic capabilities of Slack integration, demonstrating how to send reminder messages and initiate direct messages. These messages can be sent either to a general channel or as a direct message to a specific user.

```tsx
// Post message into a channel
await app.client.chat.postMessage({
  channel: <SLACK_CHANNEL_ID>,
  message: createMessage()
});

// Or send the message as direct message to a user
const result = await app.client.conversations.open({
  token: <SLACK_BOT_TOKEN>
  users: <SLACK_USER_ID>, 
});

await app.client.chat.postMessage({
  channel: result.channel?.id,
  message: createMessage()
});
```

Finally, to connect the event bridge with the lambda function, we create a rule. This rule specifies the event pattern and targets the lambda function, ensuring that the right actions are triggered by specific events.

```tsx
new Rule(homeViewLambda, "on-home-view-opened", {
  eventBus,
  eventPattern: {
    source: ["application.slackIntegration"],
    detailType: ["app_home_opened"],
  },
  targets: [new LambdaFunction(homeViewLambda.homeViewFunction)],
});
```

**Create Landing Lambda API**

Having established our event bus and set up functions to forward events, it's time to implement the initial landing Lambda function. This function acts as the primary receiver for all incoming, unfiltered requests from the Slack application.

The landing Lambda API filters actions based on their action IDs. This filtering is essential for routing requests accurately. We specify a source, in this case 'application.slackIntegration', to align with our predefined event rules. While we have the flexibility to define source and destination values, it's crucial to match them with the event rules established earlier for consistent event handling.

The following code demonstrates the setup of the landing Lambda API:

```tsx
const eventBridge = new EventBridgeAdapter();

// Handle 'app_home_opened' event
app.event('app_home_opened', async ({ event: home_event, context: home_context }) => {
  const token = home_context.botToken;
  const user = home_event.user;

  await eventBridge.putEvent(
    'application.slackIntegration', // SOURCE
    { token, user },                // Variables to forward
    'app_home_opened',              // DESTINATION
  );
});

// Handle 'home_button_click' action
app.action('home_button_click', async ({ ack, action }) => {
  await ack();
  await eventBridge.putEvent(
    'application.slackIntegration',
    { ...action },
    'reminder.clicked',
  );
});

// ... Continue with possible actions

const response = await awsLambdaReceiver.start();
return response(event, context, callback);
```

**Create Stack to Link Services**

In the final step, we establish an API Gateway. This serves as a crucial bridge between our internal AWS resources and the external Slack application, facilitating seamless communication. Utilizing CloudFormation and the CDK for stack creation offers effortless management of resources. This approach allows for easy construction and deconstruction of services as needed, providing flexibility and control over our cloud infrastructure.

The following code snippet illustrates how to configure the API Gateway and link it with Lambda functions designed for handling specific Slack events:

```tsx

// Initialize the Slack Integration Lambda function
const slackIntegrationFn = new SlackIntegration(this, 'slackIntegrationFn', {
  eventBus: eventBridge.bus
});

// Configuring the Slack API in API Gateway
const slack = api.root.addResource('slack');
const events = slack.addResource('events');
const slackIntegrationFnIntegration = new LambdaIntegration(
  slackIntegrationFn.slackIntegrationFunction,
);
events.addMethod('POST', slackIntegrationFnIntegration);

// Setting up individual Lambda functions for each Slack event
new homeViewLambda(this, "homeViewFn", {
  eventBus: eventBridge.bus,
});

```

**Conclusion**
