### **Introduction**

- Slack is popular communication platform adopted by much of tech community
- Can be extended through use of apps and integrations
- Apps can be built custom using the Bolt framework and hosted with a serverless backend
- Automated emails, while functional, may not engage effectively compared to direct alerts.
- Custom app examples could include automated internal ops procedures, interactive alerts, translation bots.
- Can  link bots to LLMs

- Serverless is awesome. Scale to zero, automatic scaling and cost optimisation
- The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) simplifies cloud resource deployment for developers.
- CDK operates like blueprints for constructing buildings, translating project ideas into cloud services.
- Infrastructure-as-code (IAC) streamlines cloud infrastructure design, deployment, and management.

### **Create a New Slack App**

- Follow the steps in the Slack API Hello World tutorial to create a basic Slack app.
- Take note of the SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET and SLACK_BOT_TOKEN found in the Basic Information and OAuth & Permissions pages, these are key for the app's functionality and security.
- Keep the console open for later use to finish the Interactivity and Event Subscriptions sections.

### **Backend Serverless Stack**

- CDK is a toolkit for creating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using the full capabilities of modern programming languages.
- The toolkit supports scalability, repeatability, and efficient resource management.
- Developers can model and provision cloud resources in their preferred language.
- The process to automate business operations involves starting with individual resources like lambdas and an event bus and then interconnecting these components to form a complete stack.
- The provided architectural diagram previews the expected schematic.
- The diagram acts as a guide, showing the flow and dependencies between the various components.
- As the resource creation details are explained, refer to this diagram.

### **Set Up an EventBridge Event Bus**

- The main point of interaction between the Slack application and AWS backend is the /slack/events API endpoint.
- This endpoint is crucial for managing interactions between Slack and AWS.
- An EventBus is important for parsing and routing various events and actions.
- The EventBus applies rules to determine where to forward incoming events.
- The putEvent function, a key component, uses the EventBridge client to handle event distribution.
- Each event is routed to a designated Lambda function for processing, based on its unique action.
- The code for the EventBridge Adapter and the putEvent function is provided below.

```
export class EventBridgeAdapter {
  eventBus: string;

  constructor(eventBus: string) {
    this.eventBus = eventBus;
  }

  putEvent(
    action: string,
    payload: Record<string, unknown>,
    detailType: string,
  ): Promise<PutEventsCommandOutput> {

    const event: PutEventsRequestEntry = {
      Source: action,
      Detail: JSON.stringify({ ...payload }),
      DetailType: detailType,
      EventBusName: this.eventBus,
    };

    client = new EventBridgeClient();

    const command = new PutEventsCommand({
      Entries: [event],
    });

    return client.send(command);
  }
}
```

### **Event Lambda Handlers**

- The creation of Lambda functions is discussed, which are designed for different Slack events.
- Two example actions demonstrate how lambda structures can be adapted.
- The Slack application is communicated with using the Bolt family of SDKs, which simplifies event parsing and response sending.
- A new Bolt App and AWSLambdaReceiver must be instantiated in each lambda handler.
- Initializing these variables within the handler prevents issues from persistent data, such as unintended actions or delayed responses.
- This creation process can be abstracted into a helper function for convenience.

```
export const instantiateApp = (): {
  app: App;
  awsLambdaReceiver: AwsLambdaReceiver;
} => {
  const awsLambdaReceiver = new AwsLambdaReceiver({
    signingSecret: getEnvVariable('SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET'),
  });

  const app = new App({
    token: getEnvVariable('SLACK_BOT_TOKEN'),
    receiver: awsLambdaReceiver,
  });

  return { app, awsLambdaReceiver };
};
```

- The initial function development aimed at creating a system that automatically translates channel messages.
- The details of the underlying translation function are not discussed in this article for simplicity.
- The system demonstrates the integration with external SaaS platforms and handling of time-consuming requests.
- An encountered issue was Slack occasionally sending duplicate responses.
- This duplication occurs because Slack retries after only three seconds when no response is received.
- The solution involved identifying retry attempts from the X-Slack-Retry-Num field in the headers and ignoring any repetitions.
- Not responding to these retries prevents the channel from being filled with duplicate responses as Slack does not retry indefinitely.

```
export const handler = async event => {
  const { headers, message } = event

  const retryAttempts = headers['X-Slack-Retry-Num']
  if (retryAttempts !== '0') {
    return                        // Ignore the retry attempts
  }

  const { app, awsLambdaReceiver } = instantiateApp();

  const { text, channel, ts, thread_ts } = message;
  if (thread_ts !== undefined) {
    return;                       // Don't translate thread replies
  }

  const translation = await translate(text);
  const blocks = formatMessage(translation);

  await app.client.chat.postMessage({
    token: <SLACK_BOT_TOKEN>,
    channel,
    thread_ts: ts,
    blocks,
  });

  const response = await awsLambdaReceiver.start();
  return response(event, context, callback);
}
```

- The `app_home_opened` event is triggered when a user accesses the home tab of the app.
- The purpose of the associated lambda function is to generate a user-specific page.
- This page can contain personalised content such as targets, countdowns, or data sourced from external services like DynamoDB.
- If location data is accessible, the page could show the weather forecast.
- Slack messages or views are structured from blocks.

```
export const handler = async event => {
  const { app, awsLambdaReceiver } = instantiateApp();

  const { token, user } = event.detail;

  // Display App Home
  const homeView: HomeView = {
    type: "home",
    callback_id: "home_view",
    blocks: createBlocksView(user)
  };

  await app.client.views.publish({
    token, user, view: homeView,
  });

 await awsLambdaReceiver.start()
};
```

- A rule is created to link the event bridge and the lambda function.
- The rule defines the event pattern and targets the lambda function.
- Specific events trigger appropriate actions.

```
new Rule(homeViewLambda, "on-home-view-opened", {
  eventBus,
  eventPattern: {
    source: ["application.slackIntegration"],
    detailType: ["app.home.opened"],
  },
  targets: [new LambdaFunction(homeViewLambda.homeViewFunction)],
});
```

---

### **Landing Lambda API**

- The next step is to implement the initial landing Lambda function which acts as the main receiver for all unfiltered requests from the Slack application.
- The landing Lambda API filters actions based on action IDs to accurately route requests.
- A source, specifically `application.slackIntegration`, is defined to correspond with the previously set event rules.
- It's important to align the source and destination values with the established event rules for consistent event handling.
- The setup of the landing Lambda API is shown in the following code.

```
const eventBridge = new EventBridgeAdapter();

// Handle message translation event
app.message(async ({ message }) => {

  await eventBridge.putEvent(
    'application.slackIntegration',  // SOURCE
    {
      headers,                       // Variables to forward
      message
    },
    'message.translated',            // DESTINATION
  );
});

// Handle 'app_home_opened' event
app.event('app_home_opened', async ({ event: home_event, context: home_context }) => {
  const token = home_context.botToken;
  const user = home_event.user;

  await eventBridge.putEvent(
    'application.slackIntegration', // SOURCE
    { token, user },                // Variables to forward
    'app.home.opened',              // DESTINATION
  );
});

// ... Continue with possible actions

const response = await awsLambdaReceiver.start();
return response(event, context, callback);
```

### **Stack to Link Services**

- The last step is setting up an API Gateway, which acts as a connector between AWS resources and external Slack application for smooth communication.
- Using CloudFormation and CDK for creating stacks aids in easy resource management.
- This method supports simple building and dismantling of services on-demand, granting control over the cloud infrastructure.
- Code snippet showing how it all links together

```
export class SlackStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const slackIntegrationLambda = new SlackIntegration(this, 'slackIntegrationFn', {
      eventBus: eventBridge.bus
    });

    const api = new RestApi(this, 'RestApi');

    const slackIntegrationFnIntegration = new LambdaIntegration(
      slackIntegrationLambda.slackIntegrationFunction,
    );
    api.addMethod('POST', slackIntegrationFn);

    new homeViewLambda(this, "homeViewFn", {
      eventBus: eventBridge.bus,
    });

    new translateLambda(this, "translateLambdaFn", {
      eventBus: eventBridge.bus,
    });
  }
}
```

- After deployment, the endpoint related to the API gateway can be accessed.
- The Interactivity and Event Subscriptions sections in the Slack console can be filled out next.
- This sets up a two-way communication stream between the backend and the Slack application.
