    "1": "<p>\u200b\u200bIf you work in tech, there's a good chance your company has adopted Slack as its primary mode of communication. Slack has a variety of apps and integrations that can be used to extend its functionality. However, you can also build custom apps using the Bolt framework. When you build your app, you can host it using a serverless backend. Below, I'll discuss how to get started building a custom Slack app with Bolt and how to host it using Google Cloud Run.</p><p>I think one of the best use cases for a custom Slack app is to send direct alerts to people in your company. Automated emails can work, but they're not nearly as effective at engaging people as direct alerts in Slack. Some examples of custom apps you could build are:</p><p>Finally, if you're interested in linking bots to your LLMs, we have a post on that too!</p>",

While it may be functional, the chances that it will engage your audience as effectively as a direct alert in Slack are quite low.

Automated emails can be functional, but they're not likely to engage your users as much as direct alerts.
