The CDK makes the process of deploying cloud resources so much simpler for developers. The CDK is a framework which lets developers write cloud applications in programming languages, using high-level abstractions as if you're using a blueprint to build a building. It takes your project ideas and turns them into actual cloud services. It's another layer of abstraction on top of infrastructure-as-code (IAC), which is even more abstraction on top of cloud infrastructure.</p><p>There are a lot of smart people who are excited about the CDK, and I agree with them. It's a better way to build applications. But we need to understand what it is - and what it isn't. In this post, we'll discuss a few scenarios in which the CDK is useful and when it is not.</p>",
    "1": "<p>Serverless is awesome. You get scale-to-zero, automatic scaling and all sorts of cost optimisations. But as a function developer, you don't want to be bogged down with the complexities of AWS configuration. That's where the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) comes in. Think of CDK as a way to simplify how you deploy cloud resources as a developer - it's like blueprints that help you figure out how to construct a building in a city. It helps you think through how your project idea will translate into a number of different cloud services.</p><p>Also, I love infrastructure-as-code (IAC). IAC is a way to make sure your cloud infrastructure is designed well, deployed properly, and managed effectively.</p>",
    "2": "<p>I love serverless. It gives you scale-to-zero, automatic scaling, and it optimizes for cost. The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) makes it easier to deploy cloud resources. I like to think of the CDK as a blueprint you might use to build a building. It turns your idea for what you want to build into a set of cloud services. I also like infrastructure-as-code (IAC) to make it easy to design, deploy, and manage my cloud infrastructure.</p>",
    "3": "<p>I love serverless. You can't beat scale to zero, automatic scaling and the cost savings it provides.</p><p>I also love the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for giving us a better experience as developers when deploying cloud resources. If you're not familiar with CDK, it's like blueprints for building a building -- you write down what you want, and CDK translates that to a real building (or, in our case, cloud services).</p><p>Finally, I love infrastructure-as-code (IAC) in general, which gives us a better process for designing, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure in general.</p>",
    "4": "<p>I could write forever about how awesome serverless is. Scale to zero! Automatic scaling! Cost optimisation!</p><p>And I could go on about how great the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is for making it much easier for developers to deploy cloud resources. The CDK works like blueprints for building a building, helping to translate your project ideas into actual cloud services. It's a great way to simplify infrastructure-as-code (IAC) to help you think about your cloud infrastructure in the same way.</p>"
