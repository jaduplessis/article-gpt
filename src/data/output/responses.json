Or they can be more complicated, interactive experiences that are built into a Slack app. With the advent of the Bolt framework -- a new way to build Slack apps -- you can now build a more traditional app and host it with a serverless backend.</p><p>One common use case for this is to replace automated emails. While automated emails can be functional, there's a good chance they won't engage your users as much as a direct alert to Slack. You can also extend this to build truly custom functionality for your team. Examples could include automated internal operations procedures, interactive alerts that require responses, or translation bots.</p><p>PS: One of the most interesting concepts from my time at Slack was the idea of linking bots to LLMs. If you'd like to learn more about that, let me know and I can write more.</p>",
    "2": "<h2>Slack is a powerful platform for building internal tools\u200b</h2><p>Slack is pretty ubiquitous within the tech community.

    "3": "<p>If you work in tech, you probably use Slack. It's the de facto communication platform, and you can be fairly certain that most people you work with are on it. But what happens when you want to augment Slack to work for you? Sure, you can add some apps and integrations to your Slack workspace to get some additional functionality, but what if you want something completely custom?</p><p>There are a number of examples of how you can use Slack to build your own apps. For example, you could build a simple internal ops app to automate some of the things your team does on a regular basis. You could also build a more interactive alert system to ensure that you get the information you need when you need it, or you could build a translation bot to help you work with your international teammates.</p>",
    "4": "<p>Slack is a popular communication platform that's been widely adopted by the tech community.

    "5": "<p>Slack has become a popular communication platform, adopted by much of the tech community. However, you can extend it even further by building custom apps and integrations on top of it.

In addition, there's a big gap between automated email and a direct alert. If you are sending a custom Slack message, you have a ton of power to engage the recipient. You can ask them to take action, or provide them with the specific information they need to do so (e.g. \"click on this link to complete your request\").</p><p>Here are some examples of some custom apps you could build on Slack:</p>",
